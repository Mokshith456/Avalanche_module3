# Solidity

This project demonstrates how we can create a your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix

## Description

In this program we learn how to write a smart contract to create an ERC-20 token in solidity. This token will have all the functions of the ERC-20 features, burning capabilities, and ownership functionality through the OpenZeppelin library.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., ybu.sol). Copy and paste the following code on the code area.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.9" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile ybu.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract has been deployed we can click on the drop down button nect to the deployed contract and we will be abl to use all the various functionalities onf the program. you can mint tokens, burn tokens, transfert tokens from onw account to another, and u can also transfer the ownership of these tokens.

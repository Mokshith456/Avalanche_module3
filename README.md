# Solidity

This project demonstrates how we can create a your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix

## Description

In this program we learn how to write a smart contract to create an ERC-20 token in solidity. This token will have all the functions of the ERC-20 features, burning capabilities, and ownership functionality through the OpenZeppelin library.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste the following code on the code area. In this code we have imported libraries from OpenZeppelin.
The MOK47 contract follows the ERC-20 standard, allowing it to be compatible with various decentralized applications (DApps) and exchanges.
This contract also allows us to mint and burn tokens to enhance the functionality and flexibility.

You may go ahead and compile this contract simply by clicking "Ctrl+S" or you can also click on the complie button on the left-hand sidebar of your screen.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

Once the contract has been deployed we can click on the drop down button next to the deployed contract and we will be able to use all the various functionalities onf the program. you can mint tokens, burn tokens, transfer tokens from onw account to another, and you can also transfer the ownership of these tokens. You will need to have the Sender and the Reciever address ready with you, as for all the functions you will have to give either of them as a parameter.
